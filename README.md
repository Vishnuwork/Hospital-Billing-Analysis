# Hospital-Billing-Analysis

This project is done by using above datasets

I have created a STAR Schema Data Model

Also, I have created additional DAX table to store DAX calculated values. Please find all the DAX Queries in the DAX folder

I have transformed the data and performed Analysis and created a KPI dashboard Where it viualizes the Total Billing, Insurance Coverage, Medication Cost, Out of Pocket, Room charges and Treatment cost.

Please refer to dashboard below to get a good understanding.
